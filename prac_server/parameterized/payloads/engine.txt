CHAPTER VIII
OF THE ANALYTICAL ENGINE

The circular arrangement of the axes of the Difference Engine round large
central wheels led to the most extended prospects. The whole of arithmetic now
appeared within the grasp of mechanism. A vague glimpse even of an Analytical
Engine at length opened out, and I pursued with enthusiasm the shadowy vision.
The drawings and the experiments were of the most costly kind. Draftsmen of
the highest order were necessary to economize the labour of my own head;
whilst skilled workmen were required to execute the experimental machinery to
which I was obliged constantly to have recourse.
